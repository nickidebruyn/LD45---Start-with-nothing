# LD45---Start-with-nothing
The theme for ludum dare 45 is START WITH NOTHING. My interpretation of this theme is a game where you as player awake in a dungeon or maze and don't remember anything about where you are. The reason for this game idea is that I wish to test the cubes framework in jME and also the concept of random level generation based on the HIT game spelunky.
